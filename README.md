# PAB1_Task_with_biotrainer

## Evoplay with Biotrainer Integration

This is the repository for the Barchelor's Degree Thesis/Project carried out during the 2023/24 Winter Semester by Selin Demirt√ºrk.

It provides a modified version of [EvoPlay](https://github.com/melobio/EvoPlay)'s PAB1_GFP_task, which was first published in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00691-9). This version is integrated with the open-source tool [BioTrainer](https://github.com/sacdallago/biotrainer), simplifying the process of training machine learning models for biological applications. Its main purpose is to make the use of EvoPlay more accessible to individuals with little to no background in machine learning.

## Usage

You will need to provide the path to your dataset in order to run the script. Supported file formats are .txt, .csv, .tsv

```bash
cd PAB1_GFP_Task_with_biotrainer/
python train_m_single_m_p_pab1.py /path/to/your/dataset
```
